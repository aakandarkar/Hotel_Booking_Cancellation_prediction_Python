<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=1 data-line-end=2 ><a id="Problem_Description_1"></a>Problem Description</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">This project focuses on predicting hotel booking cancellations using machine learning. The dataset used for this purpose is the Hotel Booking Demand dataset, which contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel. The goal is to predict whether a booking will be canceled or not, based on various features associated with the booking. This is a binary classification problem where the target variable is ‘is_canceled’ (1 for canceled, 0 for not canceled). The dataset comprises 32 columns with both numerical and categorical features, amounting to 119,390 rows.</p>

<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=56 data-line-end=57 ><a id="Exercise_56"></a>Exercise</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="57" data-line-end="58">Now it’s time to assess your comprehension of this project:</p>
<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=59 data-line-end=60 ><a id="Question_What_percentage_of_bookings_in_the_dataset_were_canceled_and_how_does_this_affect_the_choice_of_evaluation_metrics_for_the_models_59"></a>Question: What percentage of bookings in the dataset were canceled, and how does this affect the choice of evaluation metrics for the models?</h5>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="60" data-line-end="61">Answer: About 37% of the bookings in the dataset were canceled. This high class imbalance indicates that accuracy may not be a suitable evaluation metric. Metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score, which are more appropriate for imbalanced datasets, should be favored.</p>
<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=61 data-line-end=62 ><a id="Question_How_does_the_models_performance_change_if_we_remove_the_lead_time_feature_from_the_dataset_61"></a>Question: How does the model’s performance change if we remove the lead time feature from the dataset?</h5>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="62" data-line-end="63">Answer: The lead time feature, measuring the days between booking and check-in, likely contributes significantly to the model’s performance. Its removal could lead to a decrease in model performance as it’s an important predictor of cancellations.</p>
<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=63 data-line-end=64 ><a id="Question_How_does_the_choice_of_classification_model_affect_the_performance_of_the_Hotel_Booking_Cancellation_Prediction_model_63"></a>Question: How does the choice of classification model affect the performance of the Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction model?</h5>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="64" data-line-end="65">Answer: The choice of classification model plays a substantial role in model performance. For instance, logistic regression suits linear relationships, while decision trees or random forests handle more complex relationships better.</p>
<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=65 data-line-end=66 ><a id="Question_What_are_some_potential_ways_to_address_the_class_imbalance_in_the_Hotel_Booking_Demand_dataset_65"></a>Question: What are some potential ways to address the class imbalance in the Hotel Booking Demand dataset?</h5>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="66" data-line-end="67">Answer: Addressing class imbalance can involve oversampling, undersampling, cost-sensitive learning, or ensemble methods like boosting or bagging to combine models.</p>
<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=67 data-line-end=68 ><a id="Question_How_can_we_interpret_the_coefficients_of_the_logistic_regression_model_for_the_Hotel_Booking_Cancellation_Prediction_problem_67"></a>Question: How can we interpret the coefficients of the logistic regression model for the Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction problem?</h5>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="68" data-line-end="69">Answer: Logistic regression coefficients indicate how the log odds of the target variable change for a one-unit increase in the corresponding feature. Positive coefficients suggest increased cancellation probability, while negative coefficients suggest decreased probability.</p>
